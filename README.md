#### It's kind of kitchy, but I hope you'll enjoy exploring my life's experiments.

### Yuli's website contains four HTML pages: 
* Home - welcome page.
* About me - CV page.
* contact - I would like to get in touch with you in the future. 
* Hobbies - list of my favorites. 

### Backend:

a. Use at list two filter applied on any variable

b. Demonstrate at list one usage of include function

c. Demonstrate at list one usage of conditions (if, else, elif)

d. Demonstrate at list one usage of any kind of loops

## Assignment 9

* There is a new template - assignment 9.
* Assignment 9 template displays two forms - one for searching your user by ID and one for signing up.
* Instead of creating a list of users, I built a MySQL table to save the user details.
[Note: I am aware that it was not requested but I was able to get into it. :)]
* Users have the option of logging out, as well as seeing their user name on each web page.
